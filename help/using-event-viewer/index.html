    <h1>Checking the Event Log</h1>
    <p>If you are on a Windows OS, and you are getting strange undocumented errors, it may be helpful to check the Event
        log. "Event Viewer" is a utility that comes with Windows which as the name suggests, logs various operations on
        your computer, from notifications to errors.</p>
    <h3>How to open Event Viewer</h3>
    <p>To open Event Viewer, on any windows OS, press both your Windows and R keys together to bring up a 'Run'
        dialogue. </p>
    <p>In the box, type in: "<strong>eventvwr</strong>" and press Enter or hit OK.</p>
    <h3>How to use Event Viewer</h3>
    <p>Once you have opened Event Viewer, you will get a branch menu at the right, that looks like this:</p><img

    <div><span style="line-height: normal;"></span>
        <div><p>From the list, expand "<strong>Windows Logs</strong>", and select "<strong>Application</strong>", you
            will get a list of events as such:</p><img

            <hr>
            <p>Sine as you can see, the list is full of hundreds of entries. </p>
            <h3>How to narrow down the issue down</h3>
            <p>To better find out what is new and what is not, we are going to clear the events, so it is easier to work
                with.</p>
            <p>To do so, go to the branch menu, right click "<strong>Application</strong>" and press "<strong>Clear
                Log...</strong>", as such:</p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/46sxjid.png">
            <hr>
            <div><p>This will give you a clean log. Right after you have done this, open the game back up and wait until
                you get the said issue.</p>
                <p>After you get the issue, go back to Event Viewer, and double click the "<strong>Application</strong>"
                    bar to refresh the list.</p>
                <p>There should be another entry right after you refresh it, usually a <strong>Warning or Error</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Right click the event and Select Copy  → Copy Details as Text.</p></div>

            <hr>
            <p>This will copy the event details to your clipboard.</p>
            <p>Once you have this, give it to whoever is helping you.</p></div>
