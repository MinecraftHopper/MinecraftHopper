## Finding the Minecraft Data Folder
You may need to find the Minecraft data folder for many reasons, the following is a guide to do so.

### Windows
To find the Minecraft data folder on Windows, hold down the Windows key (usually a picture of the Windows logo, and typically between the Control and Alt key, usually to the left of the space bar) and then press the R key without letting go. A box should pop up, titled Run. In that box, you need to type `%appdata%\.minecraft`, then click the OK button.
